Thursdays are the most popular days to use Citibikes amongst male and female subscribers. Sundays were the most popular days to use Citibikes for male and female customers.


## Summary
Overall, males used citibikes much more than females (or unknown) during this timeframe. Saturday and Sunday were the highest use days. The highest use hours are rush hours: in the morning from 6 -8 am and in the evening from 5-7 pm. This makes sense as weekends people are off work, and during rush hours they are going to or leaving work. Subscribers used the bikes more than customers.

In order to predict if Des Moines would be a good fit for Citibikes, the population would have to be compared. Another helpful analysis would be comparing data throughout different parts of the year due to the weather. Our data analysed was during August of 2019, which likely did not involve a month with snow. Weather and population both will greatly effect whether citibikes will be successful in Des Moines or not.
